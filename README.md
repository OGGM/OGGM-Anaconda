OGGM Anaconda
=============

This repository contains files and scripts to help managing and setting up an Anaconda environment for OGGM.



Building
--------

The build scripts download and build all python modules that are needed to run OGGM.

They are intended to work on Linux, OSX(build.sh) and Windows(build.cmd).
It is required to run them from inside of an Anaconda environment.

To automaticaly update the build recipes to the latest commit from git master, an update.sh script is supplied.
